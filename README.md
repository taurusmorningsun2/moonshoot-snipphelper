## Description
![Alt Text](https://moonshotbot.app/images/bot.png)

A fast and efficient bot written in NodeJS to automatically buy and sell tokens on Moonshot as soon as liquidity is added and trade is enabled.
<br><br>
The bot is extremely fast if you use a **good** node and not a public one. With a node from Quicknode you can expect a buy/sell transaction in less than 5 seconds.
<br><br>
The bot uploaded on github is the **lite** version of the real bot. 
You do **not** get all of the features from the premium version.
